## Configuration

PyClone uses a simple YAML configuration file to define your backup strategy. Below is an example of how to structure your configuration:

```yaml
backup:
  - source: /path/to/source
    destination: remote:backup
    schedule: daily
    retention: 30

    to: user@example.com
    from: noreply@example.com
    smtp_server: smtp.example.com
```

### Configuration Options

- **source**: Path to the files you want to back up.
- **destination**: Rclone remote destination.
- **schedule**: Frequency of the backup (e.g., daily, weekly).
- **retention**: Number of days to keep backups.
